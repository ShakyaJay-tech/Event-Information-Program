This was the final project I had to do to complete the COMP 218 - Fundamentals of Programming course.

The purpose of this program was to document information about planned events based on user input.

This required a good understanding of how to define and use a class, manipulate a one-dimensional array, and structures.

Out of all the projects I had to complete for this course, this was by far the toughest, but I was able to submit it on time without sacrificing quality.
