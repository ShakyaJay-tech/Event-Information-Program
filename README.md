This was the final project I had to do to complete the COMP 218 - Fundamentals of Programming course.
This required a good understanding of classes, functions, strucures, arrays etc.
Out of all the projects I had to complete for this course, this was by far the toughest, but I was able to submit it on time without sacrificing quality.
